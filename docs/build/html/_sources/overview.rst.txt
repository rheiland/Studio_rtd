.. _overview:

PhysiCell Studio is a graphical tool to help create PhysiCell models, run simulations, and interactively visualize results. 

*CAUTION:* Unless you use `File -> Save as` to save the loaded file into a different file, when you run a 
simulation (in the Run tab), all parameters from the Studio will be automatically saved to the 
current .xml file.
