Installation
------------

Currently, you can install PhysiCell Studio using one of two ways: 

#. download a Release of just the Studio Python code from https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-model-builder/releases. This assumes your computer has the necessary dependencies: a Python distribution with the appropriate modules installed that are needed by the Studio. We recommend the Anaconda Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

#. download a standalone, bundled (.zip) package which includes all dependencies. Those are available at: 

    * https://www.dropbox.com/s/wiwdd09f8pmmyyk/PhysiCell_Studio_win.zip?dl=0 (for Windows)

    * https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8vr54p5hg3pg4n/PhysiCell_Studio_mac.zip?dl=0 (for Mac)

Note: currently, the bundled packages are only capable of plotting results for 2D models. Future bundles will allow plotting results of 3D models.


Running
-------

If you installed the Studio using option 1, refer to its `README <https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-model-builder/blob/main/README.md>`_ .

If you installed a bundled package:

* on Windows

* on Mac
